# About this project
An unofficial plugin that brings the HUAWEI HarmonyOS/EMUI 12/OpenAtom Foundation OpenHarmony's Interface to flutter.

Experience the best of both worlds in a single application! 

We aim to make a pixel perfect clone of HUAWEI's ArkUI Library and widget support too.

If you like this project, please consider contributing to get more features and leave issues if there are bugs or feature requests.
